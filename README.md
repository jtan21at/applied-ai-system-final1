# 🎵 VibeFinder 1.0 – AI-Powered Music Recommender

## Original Project

**VibeFinder** (built in Modules 1–3) is a content-based music recommender. Given a user's preferred genre, mood, energy level, and acoustic taste, it scores every song in a 20-song catalog using a weighted rule set and returns a ranked list of suggestions. Each recommendation includes a plain-language explanation so every result is transparent and inspectable.

---

## What's New in the Final Version

This submission extends VibeFinder with a fully integrated **Reliability and Testing System** — the chosen advanced AI feature. The system now:

- **Scores confidence** on every recommendation (0 %–100 %), letting the system communicate how certain it is.
- **Validates inputs** with guardrails that raise and log clear errors for bad user preferences.
- **Logs every action** to `recommender.log` for full observability.
- **Evaluates itself** via an automated evaluation harness (`src/evaluate.py`) with 8 predefined test cases including edge cases and guardrail checks.

## Design Decisions

### Scoring weights
Genre carries the highest weight (2.0) because it is the coarsest taste signal — a rock fan and a lofi fan have fundamentally different catalogs. Mood is worth half as much (1.0) because mood can overlap across genres. Energy is a continuous score (0–1) that always contributes something without hard cutoffs. The acoustic bonus (+0.5) is intentionally small so it nudges results without dominating them.

### Confidence scoring
The maximum possible raw score is 4.5 (genre 2.0 + mood 1.0 + energy 1.0 + acoustic 0.5). Dividing the raw score by 4.5 gives an interpretable 0–1 confidence that can be shown to users and used by the evaluation harness to flag low-confidence outputs.

### Guardrails over silent defaults
The original code silently fell back to default values when preferences were missing or invalid. Replacing this with an explicit `validate_user_prefs()` that raises `ValueError` and logs a warning makes failures visible rather than hidden.

### Logging strategy
All INFO-level events (songs loaded, recommendation generated) go to both the console and `recommender.log`. DEBUG-level detail goes to the file only so the terminal stays readable. This gives developers full observability without cluttering normal output.

### Trade-offs
Binary genre/mood matching means no partial credit for near-matches (e.g. "indie pop" ≠ "pop"). A static 20-song catalog limits diversity. Both are known limitations documented in the Model Card.

## Testing Summary

| Layer | Tool | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | `pytest` (14 tests) | **14/14 passed** |
| Evaluation harness | `src/evaluate.py` (8 cases) | **8/8 passed** |
| Avg confidence across profiles | — | **0.88** |

The AI struggled in one edge case: `genre=pop, mood=sad, energy=0.9`. There are no sad pop songs in the catalog, so the mood point was never awarded to any result. The system correctly fell back to genre+energy, but returned recommendations that ignored the mood preference with no user-visible warning — a known limitation now documented in the Model Card.

Confidence scores averaged 0.88 across the six recommendation test cases. The lowest-confidence case was the conflicting-preference edge case (0.66), which makes sense because the mood dimension was unserviceable.

---

## Algorithm Description

```
score = 0
if song.genre == user.favorite_genre   → +2.0  (genre match)
if song.mood  == user.favorite_mood    → +1.0  (mood match)
score += 1.0 − |song.energy − user.target_energy|  (energy proximity, 0.0–1.0)
if user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness ≥ 0.6 → +0.5  (acoustic bonus)

confidence = score / 4.5   (normalised to [0.0, 1.0])
```

## Reflection

See the complete **[Model Card](model_card.md)** for algorithm details, bias analysis, evaluation results, and AI collaboration reflection.

Building this recommender made clear how much of what feels like "magic" in real apps is actually straightforward arithmetic — just done at enormous scale with far richer features. The surprising moment was discovering how a single weight choice (genre at 2.0 vs. 1.0) can completely change the character of a recommendation list.

Adding the reliability layer revealed that the system *seemed* smarter than it was: the edge-case test exposed that it silently degraded when the catalog couldn't satisfy a preference, rather than warning the user. Making that failure visible — through confidence scores, logging, and guardrails — is what separates a prototype from a trustworthy system.

---

## Limitations and Risks

- Catalog is only 20 songs — results can feel repetitive
- No understanding of lyrics, artist popularity, or listening history
- Genre and mood matching is exact; "Indie Pop" ≠ "pop" unless normalised
- System treats all users as having a single fixed taste profile
- Silent filter-bubble effect when catalog lacks songs matching a requested mood
- No temporal or contextual awareness (time of day, device, context)
